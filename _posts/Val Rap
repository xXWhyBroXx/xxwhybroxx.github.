Yeah yeah, I got love for Valorant
It's the game that gets me hype, understand?
But when it comes to love, man, that's the real deal
It's the one thing that'll make your heart spill

See, Valorant gets your adrenaline pumpin'
But love, man, it'll leave you jumpin'
Higher than any headshot you've ever made
It's the kind of feeling that'll never fade

When I'm in love, I feel like Jett
Soarin' through the air, no need to fret
Cause I know that in your arms, I'm safe
Just like how we all have our own space

Valorant's all about teamwork, yeah?
But love, man, it takes that to the next tier
Together, we can take on any foe
And always come out on top, woah

So when life gets tough and Valorant isn't enough
Just remember, love's the stuff
That'll keep you going, keep you strong
And make you feel like you really belong 

So let's keep playing, keep fighting as a team
And let's keep loving, fulfilling each other's dreams
Valorant and love, man, they go hand in hand
And that's the kind of vibe that'll never be canned.
