Cheese balls have a long and interesting history. They originated in the United States in the 1940s, during the post-World War II era. At that time, processed cheese products such as Velveeta were becoming popular, and people were experimenting with different ways to use them.

According to some sources, the first cheese ball recipe was created by a woman named Elsa Maxwell, who was an American author, gossip columnist, and hostess famous for throwing lavish parties. Her recipe was simple, consisting of grated cheese mixed with butter, flour, and paprika, rolled into balls, and served as an appetizer.

Cheese balls became a popular party food in the 1950s and 1960s, often served at cocktail parties or other social gatherings. They were easy to make, easy to serve, and could be customized with different types of cheese, seasonings, and coatings.

Today, cheese balls continue to be a popular party food, with many variations on the original recipe. They can be made with a variety of cheeses, including cheddar, blue cheese, and goat cheese, and can be coated with nuts, herbs, or other flavorings.
