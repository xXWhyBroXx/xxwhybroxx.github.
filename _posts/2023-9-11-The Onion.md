title: The Onion is it Reputable

No but why is the onion not reputable?

because it's a joke you can see this in posts such as https://shorturl.at/boAD1 in which the entire article is a joke but its making fun of the new sources that are "reputable" as other news sources like FOX, CNN, Washington Post, etc. in which they are owned by companies or political parties to blow stories out of proportion for the satisfy views or shifting political takes of others for the benefit of its owners even at the expense of the actual pursuit of spreading knowledge of what's happing around us.

at least it is reputable for being a joke, unlike very "true" news sources around us
