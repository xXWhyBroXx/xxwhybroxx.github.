title: The Onion is it Reputable
--- 
No but why is the onion not reputable?
---

because its a joke you can see this in posts such as
https://www.theonion.com/tucker-carlson-interviews-man-claiming-that-he-and-bara-1850814139
in which the entire article is a joke but its making fun of th new sorces that are "reputable"
as other news sources like FOX, CNN, Washington Post, etc in which they're owned by companies or politcal parties
blow stories out of porpotion to satisfy views or shifting politcal taks of others for the benfit of its owners
at least it's reputable for being a joke, unlike very "true" news sources around us
