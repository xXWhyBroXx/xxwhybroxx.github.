title: The Onion is it Reputable

No but why is the onion not reputable?
---
because its a joke you can see this in posts such as
https://www.theonion.com/tucker-carlson-interviews-man-claiming-that-he-and-bara-1850814139
in which the entire article is a joke 
atleast it's reputable for being a joke unlike this very serious blog
